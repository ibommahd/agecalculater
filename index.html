<p>The Age Calculator helps find the difference in time between two dates. It shows the result in years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.</p><div id="insmdc"><img src="https://github.com/ibommahd/agecalculater/assets/128987269/5e20f2ac-1f60-4ba2-a935-cf1f21d00809"></div>

<p>In different cultures, people count a person's age in various ways. This calculator uses the most common age system where your age goes up by one on your birthday. For instance, if you have lived for 21 years and 11 months, your age is 21. When your next birthday comes one month later, your age will become 22. This age system is commonly used in most western countries.</p>
<p>In certain cultures, age is calculated differently, sometimes including the current year and sometimes not. For instance, if a person is twenty years old, they are considered the same age as someone who is in their twenty-first year of life. In the traditional Chinese age system, people are considered to be one year old at birth, and their age increases with the arrival of the Traditional Chinese New Year, not their actual birthday. For example, if a baby is born just one day before the Traditional Chinese New Year, they will be considered 2 years old only two days later, even though they are actually just 2 days old.</p>

<p>Sometimes, this age calculator may give confusing results, especially when the starting date is at the end of a month. For example, if we count from February 11 to March 11, we consider it as one month. However, calculating the age from February 11, 2023, to March 30, 2023, can be done in two ways.

If we count from February 28 to March 28 as one month, then the result is one month and three days. But if we consider both February 28 and March 31 as the end of the month, then the result is just one month. Both calculations make sense. Similar situations occur for dates like April 29 to May 30, May 30 to June 30, and so on. The confusion arises due to the different number of days in different months. In our calculations, we use the first method.</p>
